Introduction
	Overwatch is a competitive shooter that uses an elo rank system to place players within their skill rankings. This helps the system make more balanced games for players. Player stats are put through some kind of black box that overwatch uses to categorize players. The purpose of this project is to replicate this black box if someone used the character “mercy”. Mercy is a simple character with a few major stats making her the easiest to use. Four stats - healing, deaths, revives, and damage boosted - are used.

Procedure
	The environment was created in Python 3.7.3. Stats were first gathered from Overwatch players who play Mercy. Stats were from Overbuff.com and random players. Using Pandas version 0.25.3, the data is printed into a graph for better understanding.
	
	The data is normalized by add (ask Dr. Waddel). This is only done to damage and healing stats. This new data set is put through the neural network. To test how accurate the neural network is, the data shuffles with the random seed “0”. The code prints a percent of how accurate the process is.

Conclusion
	Overwatch sorts players based off of player stats. The stats the program used were from real players. A neural network simulated the black box Overwatch used to balance the game. The results were about 85% accurate. The network could be further improved by using all of the characters stats instead of a selected few.
