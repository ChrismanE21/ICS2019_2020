Introduction
	Overwatch is a competitive shooter that uses an elo rank system to place players within their skill rankings. Player stats are put through some kind of black box that overwatch uses to categorize players. The purpose of this project is to replicate this black box if someone used the character “mercy”. Mercy is a simple character with a few major stats making her the easiest to use. Four stats - healing,deaths,revives,damage boosted - are used.

Procedure
	The eviorment is created and ran in Python 3.7.3. Stats are first gathered from Overwatch players who play Mercy. Stats are from Overbuff.com, random players, and from friends.
	
	The data frist is normalized in two different ways. The stats for healing and damage for high in the ten thousands and thousands respectively. The healing stats are divided by ten thousands and damage stats are divided by one thousand. This new data set is put through the neural network. The alternate method is by normalizing the data with a fercercy datagram. This method produces a percent of fercercy.
	
	To test how accurate the neural network is, the same data used is randomize with the random seed “1”. The code prints a percent of how accurate the process is.
